ReactiveOps Technical Challenge

# Assignment

* Using any language you prefer, write code that brings up an EC2 instance running the default page of a web application after running a single command.
* The command can (and likely will) call a longer shell script, or other configuration management code.
* The web application can be any common framework (Django, Rails, Symfony, etc.), but not the default Nginx or Apache setup.
* Your credentials are attached (including the assigned region). The credentials do not have access to EKS, ECS, S3, or Route53.
* If needed, you can manually create pre-requisites such as ssh key pairs and the like.
* _Before the script is run, there should be no compute instances running and afterward the script should output the address of your working web application._

# Evaluation Criteria

* Please don't take more than 3 hours total over the next few days.
* Timekeeping is up to you and we expect your finished response in a reasonable amount of time.
* You are being evaluated based on the quality of your code and configuration, on the clarity of your communication, and on project presentation.
* Source control is expected as well as documentation that should explain how you approached the challenge, what assumptions you've made, and reasoning behind the choices in your approach.


Please reach out with any questions or clarifications.
Good Luck!
